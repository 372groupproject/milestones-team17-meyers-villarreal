We will discuss in our video the following:

  What is scala
  How was scala formed
  What is its main purpose
 
  How can one use scala
  Looking at some bits of code involving scala
  What makes it unique from Java
  Show off perhaps some comparisions from other coding languages to show benefits
  
  Show off the project involving scala code (A Card game)
  
How will we demo the things we talk about:
  
  Create a powerpoint that can be used as a structure to talk about
  Can use screen capturing software to record our computer screens (OBS is somewhat easy and free)
  Edit the footage into a 3-5 minute video in a mix of powerpoint, code samples, and project demo
